1. **Nouns**: Nouns are words that represent people, places, things, or ideas. They can be:
	- common nouns (e.g., dog, city) or 
	- proper nouns (e.g., John, London).

3. **Articles**: Articles are small words that precede nouns. There are three articles in English: **a, an, and the**:  
    - **Definite Article**: "The" is used before a specific noun that both the speaker and the listener are aware of (e.g., "The cat is on the table").
    - **Indefinite Articles**: "A" is used before a singular noun that is not specific (e.g., "A dog is barking"). "An" is used before a singular noun that starts with a vowel sound (e.g., "An apple is delicious").
  
3. **Adjectives**: Adjectives modify nouns and provide additional information about them. They describe qualities, characteristics, or attributes. For example, in the phrase "a beautiful flower," "beautiful" is an adjective describing the noun "flower."
   
4. **Adverbs**: Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. They provide information about how, when, where, or to what extent something happens. For example, in the phrase "She sings beautifully," "beautifully" is an adverb describing the verb "sings."
   
5. **Verb Tenses**: Verbs indicate actions, states, or occurrences. English has several verb tenses, including:
    - **Present Simple**: Used for general truths or habitual actions (e.g., "I eat breakfast every day").
    - **Past Simple**: Used for actions that happened in the past and are completed (e.g., "She watched a movie last night").
    - **Future Simple**: Used for actions that will happen in the future (e.g., "I will call you tomorrow").

6. **Subject-Verb Agreement**: The subject and verb in a sentence must agree in number (singular or plural). For example, "He runs" (singular subject) and "They run" (plural subject).
   
7. **Prepositions**: Prepositions indicate relationships between nouns, pronouns, or other words in a sentence. They often show location, direction, time, or manner. Examples include "in," "on," "at," "to," and "from" (e.g., "She is going to the park").
   
8. **Conjunctions**: Conjunctions join words, phrases, or clauses together. Common conjunctions include "and," "but," "or," and "because" (e.g., "I like ice cream, but I don't like cake").
