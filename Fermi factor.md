## Key Points

### 1. Absorption Spectra and Material Parameters

- Absorption spectra are expressed as the product of a material parameter (AP) and the reduced density of states.
- Previous derivations assumed transitions between filled and empty states in the valence and conduction bands.
- The probability of states being filled or empty needs to be considered.

### 2. Probability Factors and Fermi Factor

- The absorption spectra is multiplied by the probability that the initial and final states are filled and empty, respectively.
- Probability factors are calculated using the Fermi factor, accounting for the statistical behavior of fermions (electrons).
- Fermi factors are evaluated at the energies of the initial (e1) and final (e2) states.

### 3. Fermi Factor Calculation

- Fermi factor at energy e1: 1 / (1 + exp((e1 - EF) / (kT))), where EF is the Fermi energy.
- Non-equilibrium situations replace the Fermi energy with the valence band or hole Fermi energy (FV).
- Fermi factor at energy e2: Same expression as e1, but with the conduction band Fermi energy (FC).

### 4. Absorption Coefficient with Fermi Factors

- Total absorption coefficient considers both absorption and stimulated emission.
- Absorption coefficient is multiplied by the Fermi inversion factor (FV - FC).
- Fermi inversion factor determines the sign of the absorption coefficient.

## Important Concepts

### 1. Absorption Spectra

The representation of the absorption of light by a material as a function of photon energy.

### 2. Material Parameters

Parameters specific to the material, such as AP (related to the material's properties) and density of states.

### 3. Fermi Factor

A factor that describes the probability of electron states being filled or empty, based on Fermi-Dirac statistics.

### 4. Valence Band and Conduction Band

Energy bands in a solid material where valence electrons and conducting electrons, respectively, reside.

### 5. Stimulated Emission

The process where an electron in the conduction band is stimulated by incoming light to transition to an empty state in the valence band.

### 6. Fermi Energy

The energy level that separates filled and empty states at absolute zero temperature, indicating the highest occupied state.

### 7. Equilibrium and Non-equilibrium

Equilibrium refers to a state where no external influences are present, while non-equilibrium implies the presence of external perturbations (e.g., injecting light).

### 8. Fermi Inversion Factor

The difference between the Fermi factors of the valence and conduction bands, determining the sign of the absorption coefficient.

# Fermi Inversion Factor

The lecture discusses the Fermi inversion factor and its role in the absorption equation. Here are the key points and important concepts discussed:

## Absorption Equation

The absorption as a function of photon energy is given by the product of the absorption coefficient (alpha naught) and the Fermi inversion factor (FV - FC). The absorption coefficient was derived in previous videos, and the Fermi inversion factor modulates the absorption.

## Fermi Inversion Factor

The Fermi inversion factor is composed of two terms: FV (Fermi factor for the valence band) and FC (Fermi factor for the conduction band). Together, they form the Fermi inversion factor.

## Relation to Gain

While some people invert the Fermi inversion factor to obtain gain as a function of photon energy, the lecture emphasizes that working with the absorption coefficient is more intuitive at this stage.

## Determining Fermi Factors

To determine the Fermi factors (FV and FC) as a function of photon energy, it is necessary to find the values of e1 and e2, which are related to the momentum (K) at which the interaction occurs. The lecture defines e1 and e2 in terms of kinetic energy and establishes a reference point (e=0) at the valence band edge.

## Photon Energy Relation

The lecture establishes that the photon energy is equal to the difference between e2 and e1. By assuming a reference point at the valence band edge, e2 and e1 can be expressed in terms of the band gap energy (EG), the photon energy, and the reduced mass.

## Zero Crossing

The Fermi inversion factor can be negative or zero. The zero crossing is mathematically determined by the numerator of the factor. The lecture presents an equation in the form of e^x - 1 = 0, where x is related to the photon energy and the difference between the Fermi levels (Delta EF).

## Absorption and Gain

For small photon energies, the Fermi inversion factor can result in negative absorption or gain. At the crossover point when the photon energy equals the Fermi level splitting (Delta EF), the Fermi factor becomes positive. For larger photon energies, absorption is always observed.

## Importance in Optoelectronics

The Fermi level splitting (Delta EF) determines whether absorption or gain occurs. It is a central quantity of importance in optoelectronics.

These concepts provide a foundation for further exploration of the Fermi inversion factor and its implications in optoelectronic systems.
