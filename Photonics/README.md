## Core questions that this course answers:

1. How does light interact with matter: 
	1. absorbsion - primary focus
	2. reflection
	3. transmission
2. How can we create devices that manipulate light: studying the emmission spectrum etc.
	1. lasers
	2. LEDs
	3. Absorbtion modulators 
3. Linking different subsystems
	1. quantum mechanics
	2. electromagnetics
	3. circuits
	4. device physics
	5. optics in general
	6. electronics

## Flow of the course

1. We start with systems with two energy levels: 
	1. How does the system behave when a photon is injected.
	2. Where do the electrons go 
	3. Such questions
2. Analysis of band structure of materials and energy momentum diagrams: this helps us understand how electrons and holes, and photons are emitted and absorbed by these materials. We'll analyse quasi fermi levels 
3. Absorption and gain spectrum of semiconductor devices or bulk material (slabs of material eg: germanium slab) 
4. Analysis of carrier concentration of the material and the gain (negative absorbtion)
5. More on negative absorbtion and lasers! - negative absorption important
6. Quantum wells
7. Quantum wires and quantum dots 
8. Making of quantum wells and their conduction and valence band 
9. Understanding hetrostructures and analysis
10. Understanding mirrors/resonators, why use resonators in the first place
11. Scattering matrix to analyse the resonators and transfer matrix are used in practice
12. After all the above we can finally understand things like: 
	1. LEDs
	2. Lasers
	3. Modulators - Jordan's research topic
	4. Photodetectors
13. We'll study 
	1. Noise 
	2. Steady state
	3. Dynamic analysis: How fast can my photodiode operate for example
14. Waveguides: Relevent to SiPh
	1. Optical fiber
	2. Slab waveguide
	3. Rectangular waveguide
15. Maybe some topics like coupled-mode theory
