## Stimulated Emission

- Stimulated emission is the process by which lasers operate.
- It involves a two-level energy system, where electrons transition between energy states in response to an applied electric field.
- The transition rate from state one to state two is calculated using the equation 
	- W = (QEâ‚€ / 2h-bar) * matrix element.
- If the electron is initially in state two, the same transition rate is observed when the roles of states one and two are swapped.
- Electrons transitioning from state two to state one emit a photon of the same frequency as the incoming photon and are phase-locked to it.

## Absorption

- Absorption occurs when electrons in state one absorb photons with a corresponding frequency, resulting in their transition to state two.

## Stimulated Emission vs. Absorption

- The occurrence of stimulated emission or absorption depends on the initial energy state of the electrons.
- If there are more electrons in state one, absorption predominates.
- If there are more electrons in state two, stimulated emission predominates.
- When an equal number of electrons exist in both states, there is no net absorption or stimulated emission, leading to transparency.

## Transparency

- Transparency refers to the condition where the number of absorbed photons equals the number of stimulated and emitted photons.
- In transparency, the net absorption coefficient is zero, resulting in no overall absorption of the electromagnetic field passing through the material.

## Absorption Coefficient and Gain

- The overall absorption coefficient determines the amount of light absorbed versus stimulated.
- The sign of the absorption coefficient (alpha) depends on the relative number of electrons in state two versus state one.
- A positive alpha indicates more electrons in state one, while a negative alpha indicates gain or optical gain of the material.

## Calculation and Future Topics

- The video mentions calculating the overall absorption coefficient (alpha) in future videos.
- The calculation will involve considering the number of carriers (electrons) in state two versus state one.
- Positive or negative values of alpha will be discussed, indicating the presence of gain in the material.
