## Introduction

- The goal of the lecture is to derive an equation for the absorption coefficient (alpha) of a semiconductor.
- The transition rate (W) of an electron from one energy state to another under the influence of an electromagnetic field is discussed using Fermi's golden rule.
- The transition rate is given by W = Q * E / (2 * h-bar) * dipole matrix element * delta function (Delta Omega).

## Calculation of Electron Number

- The number of electrons in a specific energy state (e1) is determined by the reduced density of states, which is a function of the energy separation (Delta e) between energy levels.
- The reduced density of states equation is provided as: 4 * pi * 2 * (reduced mass)^(3/2) / (h^3) * (Delta e - band gap energy).
- The number of electrons in all energy states can be obtained by integrating the reduced density of states over the energy separation.

## Absorption Coefficient Equation

- To obtain the absorption coefficient, the transition rate equation is multiplied by the delta function (Delta e - photon energy) and integrated over all energy states.
- The integration simplifies to the density of states at the photon energy multiplied by a pre-factor (B).
- The pre-factor B can be expressed as a function of the electric field (E0) and is related to the optical intensity.
- The absorption coefficient is defined as the absorbed photons per second per unit area divided by the incident photons per second per unit area.
- The incident photon count can be calculated from the optical intensity divided by the photon energy.
- By substituting the value of B in terms of the electric field and converting the intensity to the electric field, the absorption coefficient equation is derived.

## Final Absorption Coefficient Equation

- The absorption coefficient (alpha) as a function of photon energy is given by: alpha = photon energy * pi * Q^2 * E0^2 / (n * h-bar) * |dipole matrix element|^2 * density of states at photon energy.
- The dipole matrix element magnitude squared and the density of states can be calculated using specific values for the photon energy.

## Conclusion

- The absorption coefficient equation provides a measure of how light interacts with matter, specifically how light is absorbed by a semiconductor or any material.
- The absorption coefficient allows for the calculation of light decay and absorption as it passes through a material.
