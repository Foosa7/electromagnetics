### Individual atoms: Interaction
- When two electrons interact the wave functions have a constructive and distructive interference
- Stable lower orbitols do not interact generally, these just add up 1+1
- The higher level orbitols generally split 

### Multiple to many atoms
- When 8x of 3s orbitols interact we'll have 8 different energy levels
- This model is called LCAO - linear combination of atomic orbitals
- valance level orbitals have splitting
- Number of orbitals = no of orbitals out

### Macroscopic object
- If the seperation of the energy level is so small it's then called a band. Large number of very closely spaced atoms
- Silicon has both 3s and 3p levels: when combined gives us just two continious band with a small sepration
	- Valence band 
	- Eg (Band gap)
	- Conduction band
