## Summary
- Fermi level represents the highest energy level occupied by electrons at absolute zero temperature. 
- The position of the Fermi level with respect to the energy bands in a material determines whether it behaves as a conductor, an insulator, or a semiconductor.
- Fermi level breakdowns for a non intrinsic semiconductor when the system is not in the thermodynamic equilibrium. i.e. When exposed to voltage, light etc. We use quasi-fermi levels.
- Quasi-Fermi levels represent the energy levels that describe the occupation probabilities of electrons and holes within the conduction and valence bands.

## What's a Fermi level?
The **Fermi level** of a solid state body is the [thermodynamic work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_work) required to add one electron to the body. The Fermi level does not include the work required to remove the electron from wherever it came from. The Fermi level breaks down under dopped conditions
quantity usually denoted by _µ_ or _E_F

## What is Fermi Energy

### [The Fermi Energy What does it Mean? Lecture 14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sH5HkF-9X2c&list=PLmfHzApbF5dYnZTqPDsJj31mOQtD7vDT2&index=15)
- the **valence band** and **conduction band** are the [bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_band_structure "Electronic band structure") closest to the [Fermi level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_level "Fermi level"), and thus determine the [electrical conductivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductivity "Electrical conductivity") of the solid.
- **Band Gap:** Energy range in a solid where no electron states can exist due to the quantization of energy.
- **Conduction band:**  Lowest range of vacant electronic states
- For every electron in the conduction there's a hole in the valence band or an ionised doner n = p.
- A voltmeter _measures differences in Fermi level divided by electron charge_

#### Consiquences of n = p
- Fermi energy is ~ (Ev + Ec)/2
- We care about the difference between fermi energy and valence energy generally
Come back to this topic tomorrow


- For N-type semiconductor the fermi level will be in the top half In the band diagram.
- Very powerful helped us understand PN, BJT, MOS
- Breaks down under non equilibrium (injected electron or injected holes)

## Factors effecting the fermi level
- Doping: Adding N-type (donors) raises the fermi level, and P-type (acceptors) lowers it.
- Band bending: When semiconductor is in contact with another material or under the influence of external electric fields the bands can bend.
- Temperature: At higher temperature the fermi level tends to move to the middle of the bandgap.

## Why quasi-fermi level
- Take a semiconductor and shine light forever, this generates holes and electrons
- In steady state we have a generation rate in which the number of holes and electrons keep adding with the generation rate this is determined by the _continuity equation_.
- The problem arises due to two different fermi levels one for electrons and another for the holes.
- When this happens the fermi energy is not defined anymore we then define quasi fermi energy as they are both different: quasi fermi energy for holes, quasi fermi energy for electrons.
- The electron fermi level moves up and the holes one moves down.
- These quasi fermi levels are _SUPER_ useful in opto-electrons so it's important to understand what this is all about.

## Fermi-Dirac Integral 
- The video discusses the Fermi-Dirac integral and its application in determining the concentration of electrons in a semiconductor.



# Raw notes
- Generally in optoelectronics the quasi fermi level is well above the fermi level
- Nc parameter is a general variable that hides all the nasty, Nieman textbook 
- Once the fermi dirac integral is solved the hole and electron concentrations are obtained. The general form of the electron and hole concentrations is useful for different dimensional systems (2D, 1D, and 0D) such as quantum wells, quantum wires, and quantum dots.
