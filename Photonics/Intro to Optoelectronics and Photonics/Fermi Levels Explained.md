## two level systems:
- We have conduction and valence bands that has several bands so we simplify by picking one on the top and bottom, this is to simplify the calculation
- What happens when there's an incoming photon in this two level system. Maybe an absorption and energy levels of the electron goes up?

## modelling the system
- We use the schrodinger equation to model the system
- we need to find the hamiltonian and the wave function is complicated so we just say psi1(x, t) and psi2(x, t)
- so psi1(x, 0) = psi2(x, 0) and eventually psi1(x, infinite) = psi2(x, infinite)
- eventually it'll be some coefficients ---- that we substitute back
