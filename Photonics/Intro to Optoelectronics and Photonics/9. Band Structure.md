## Band diagrams 101
- [Band diagram 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwDEzBG5LXg&list=PLSHXXkQ-R9aR4txzKaff7LPpHQRp0WKWO&index=1)
- The band diagram for an individual atom is different to a lattice or multiple atoms.
- When to atoms are closed to each other the wave functions interfere. Due to the interference there's constructive and destructive interference. 
- 

## Number of States

- There are actually 8 states from each atom.
- Silicon's outermost shells: 3s² and 3p².
- 3s shell has 2 states, and 3p shell has 6 states.
- Total of 8 states contribute from each atom.
- 4 states are occupied, not all 8.

## Distribution of Electrons

- When temperature is zero, all 4n electrons reside in 4n valence states.
- Total number of states with n atoms is 8n (4n conduction, 4n valence).

## Visualizing Silicon Orbitals

- Silicon has 14 electrons: 2 in 1s, 8 in 2nd shell, and 4 in outermost 3rd shell.
- 3s orbital has 2 states, and 3p orbital has 6 states.
- Total of 8 states contribute from the outermost shell.

## Interaction and Band Structure

- Electrons interact as interatomic spacing decreases.
- Main action occurs in the outermost shell.
- Innermost shell electrons remain closely bound to the nucleus.
- States in 3s and 3p orbitals split up and form continuous bands.
- 3s states split into two continuous bands.
- 3p states also split into two continuous bands.
- Some bands rise in energy, while others fall as interatomic spacing decreases.

## Lack of Overlap between Bands and the Pauli Exclusion Principle

- Expected overlap between states from 3s and 3p orbitals does not occur.
- Overlap violates Pauli exclusion principle.
- Each band represents different orbitals and must obey exclusion principle.
- Bands from different orbitals never overlap.
- Bands remain well separated in the case of silicon.
- Continuous states in conduction and valence bands.
- All states come from the outermost 3rd shell.
- Separation between conduction and valence bands creates the band gap.

## Introduction

- Band structure refers to the energy levels in semiconductors.
- Unlike two-level systems, semiconductors have entire bands of energy levels.
- Valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) are separated by a band gap.
- Density of states describes the distribution of energy levels in the bands.

## Band Picture

- Representation of energy on the y-axis and space on the x-axis.
- Each energy level in VB and CB has a specific momentum (K).
- Band structure diagrams (EK diagrams) are used to represent energy and momentum.
- Electrons in VB, no electrons in CB (at T = 0 Kelvin).

## Conservation of Momentum

- Momentum of each energy level contributes to the overall momentum.
- Momentum of absorbed photon must match the momentum of the electron.
- Photon momentum is very small compared to crystal momentum.
- Transitions in the band structure diagram are mostly vertical.

## Transition Example

- Electron near VB absorbs a photon with higher energy.
- The electron transitions to the CB but cannot occupy the available state.
- Transitions occur along the curve representing all possible states.
- Band structure provides information about allowed energy-momentum pairs.

## Conclusion

- Band structure represents all possible states in a crystal.
- Conservation of momentum determines the allowed transitions.
- Band structure diagrams are useful for understanding photon absorption.
- Next video will discuss treating band structures as two-level systems.
