### Transparency Carrier Density (NTR)

- The transparency carrier density (NTR) is the carrier density at which the Fermi level splitting (ΔEF) is equal to the band gap (EG) of the semiconductor.
- NTR is the minimum carrier density required to achieve gain and interaction with the material.

### Boltzmann Approximation

- The Boltzmann approximation assumes that the semiconductor is non-degenerate, meaning the Fermi level is at least three times the thermal energy (3KT) away from the band edge.
- If the Fermi level splitting (ΔEF) is equal to the band gap (EG), the valence band Fermi level should be about 2KT above the valence band edge, and the conduction band Fermi level should be higher.
- However, this assumption is violated in the conduction band, so an alternative method is needed to calculate the total number of electrons.

### Fermi-Dirac Integral

- The Fermi-Dirac integral can be used to calculate the carrier density without relying on the Boltzmann approximation.
- Using the Fermi-Dirac integral, the carrier density (N) is given by 2/√π times the effective density of states (NC or NV) times the Fermi-Dirac integral of order 1/2.
- The distance between the Fermi level and the conduction band (a to C) or valence band (a to V) is used as the argument in the Fermi-Dirac integral.

### Quasi-Neutrality and Approximations

- Assuming quasi-neutrality (N ≈ P), the expressions for electrons and holes can be equated.
- Making the Boltzmann approximation and the Sommerfeld approximation simplifies the Fermi-Dirac integral and allows for numerical or graphical solutions.
- The values obtained for a to C and a to V can be used to calculate the transparency carrier density (NTR).

### Calculation and Error

- The transparency carrier density can be calculated numerically or graphically using the obtained values for a to C.
- Typical values for the transparency carrier density are around 1 × 10^18 per cubic centimeter.
- Using approximations introduces some error, but it is manageable and typically within 20%.

## Absorption Spectra of a Semiconductor

- The absorption spectra of a semiconductor shows zero absorption below the bandgap energy.
- Above the bandgap, the absorption follows a square root dependence on the photon energy minus the bandgap energy.
- At low temperatures (zero Kelvin), the absorption curve is influenced by the carrier density and the transparency carrier density.
- Beyond the transparency carrier density, the absorption curve can exhibit negative absorption or gain.
- The gain curve is the negative of the absorption curve.

## Gain as a Function of Carrier Density

- Increasing the carrier density beyond the transparency carrier density leads to gain instead of absorption.
- The gain curve can be plotted as a function of photon energy, with gain becoming negative above a certain carrier density (Fermi level splitting).
- The peak gain represents the maximum gain for a given carrier density.
- The peak gain is of particular interest for efficient laser operation.

## Relationship Between Carrier Density and Peak Gain

- The peak gain can be plotted as a function of carrier density.
- Increasing the carrier density leads to an increase in the Fermi level splitting and a shift in the absorption/gain crossover point.
- The peak gain curve shows a gentle sloping line with increasing carrier density.
- The peak gain can be approximated using a logarithmic expression: G_0 * log(n / n_TR), where n is the carrier density and n_TR is the transparency carrier density.
- G_0 is a fitting parameter that depends on the semiconductor.

## Implications and Applications

- The gain expression as a function of carrier density is useful for analyzing the dynamics of lasers.
- It helps relate carrier density to the number of photons in the cavity and determines the laser's frequency response.
- The expression also provides constraints on the mirror choice for laser cavities, considering mirror losses and the required carrier density for compensation.

**Note:** The gain expression as a function of carrier density is a simplified approximation that serves as a useful tool, but it may not be perfect or accurate in all cases.
