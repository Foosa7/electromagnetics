## Overview

- Topic: Two-level systems and the time-dependent Schrödinger equation.
- Objective: Analyze the system with two energy levels (e1 and e2) under the influence of light.
- Wave functions: psi1(x, t) corresponds to energy level e1, and psi2(x, t) corresponds to energy level e2.

## The Differential Equation

- Derived differential equation: iħ(dC1/dt)e^(-iω1t)psi1(x) + iħ(dC2/dt)e^(-iω2t)psi2(x) = 0.
- Desire for separate equations for C1 and C2.

## Utilizing Inner Products and Orthogonality

- Inner product and orthogonality concepts revisited.
- psi1 and psi2 are orthogonal wave functions.
- Inner product of psi1 and psi2 is zero due to orthogonality.
- Proper normalization of psi1 and psi2 (inner products with themselves equal to 1).

## Splitting the Equation with Inner Products

- Taking the inner product of the equation with respect to psi1 and psi2 separately.
- Inner product with psi1:
    - Resulting term: iħ(dC1/dt)e^(-iω1t).
    - Inner product of psi1 with psi1 = 1.
    - Equation simplifies to dC1/dt = 0.
- Inner product with psi2:
    - Resulting term: iħ(dC2/dt)e^(-iω2t).
    - Inner product of psi1 with psi2 = 0 (orthogonality).
    - Equation simplifies to dC2/dt = 0.

## Time Independence and Probability Interpretation

- C1 and C2 do not change with time.
- If no electric field or photons are applied, an electron initially in state 1 (e1) will remain in that state indefinitely.
- Probability of being in state 1: |C1|^2.
- Probability of being in state 2: |C2|^2.

## Next Steps: Perturbation Theory and Introducing Light

- Application of perturbation theory to analyze the system under the influence of light.
- Expectation of changing coefficients over time, indicating the need for a function of time to describe their behavior.

## Conclusion

- In this video we do not apply any external field or photon and saw that the electron stays in the same band as expected and it is not time dependent
- Encouragement to practice taking inner products and understanding orthogonality.
- Introduction of perturbation theory in the next video to study the effects of light on the system.

## Notes:

- Analysis of two-level systems in the presence of external perturbations (electric field or photons).
- Modified Schrödinger equation:
    - Hamiltonian (H) is replaced by H0 + H', where H0 represents the original Hamiltonian and H' is the perturbing Hamiltonian (additional potential energy).
    - H' is a function of space and time.
- Wave function: psi(x, t) = C1 * psi1(x) * e^(-i_omega1_t) + C2 * psi2(x) * e^(-i_omega2_t)
    - omega1 = e1 / hbar
    - omega2 = e2 / hbar
- Plugging H' into the Schrödinger equation and simplifying.
- H' corresponds to the incoming electric field, represented as a traveling wave with a wavelength much larger than the distances involved in the Schrödinger equation.
- The potential derived from the electric field: V = -Q * E0 * x * cos(omega * t), where Q is the charge and E0 is the electric field amplitude.
- Perturbing Hamiltonian H' = -Q * E0 * x * cos(omega * t)
- Simplifying the equation to make it more tractable.
