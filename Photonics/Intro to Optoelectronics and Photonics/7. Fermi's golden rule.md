[[6. Two level systems]]

# Nutshell
- How do we understand what happens to materials when a photon is injected? 
- We know from QM that the solution of the Schrodinger equation gives us conditions for the wave function, that when satisfied, represents the original wave function. Remember electrons are probabilistic in nature.
- Materials have several bands so we start by simplifying it into two band system.
- We then use the Schrödinger's equation by taking advantage of the two band system. Using C1, C2.
- We then use the concept of function orthogonality between .... and ..... to further simplify the Schrödinger's equation.
- Functional orthogonality makes some terms equal to zero.
- We then want the equation in terms of C1, C2 so we simplify.
- Once we have the equation in terms of both we solve using initial conditions to derive Fermi's golden rule which gives us the generation rate of electrons from valance band to conduction band.
- The magnitude of this solution gives us the probability rate.

## Overview

- Topic: Two-level systems and the time-dependent Schrödinger equation.
- Objective: Analyze the system with two energy levels (e1 and e2) under the influence of light.
- Wave functions: psi1(x, t) corresponds to energy level e1, and psi2(x, t) corresponds to energy level e2.

## The Differential Equation

- Derived differential equation: iħ(dC1/dt)e^(-iω1t)psi1(x) + iħ(dC2/dt)e^(-iω2t)psi2(x) = 0.
- Desire for separate equations for C1 and C2.

## Utilizing Inner Products and Orthogonality

- Inner product and orthogonality concepts revisited.
- psi1 and psi2 are orthogonal wave functions.
- Inner product of psi1 and psi2 is zero due to orthogonality.
- Proper normalization of psi1 and psi2 (inner products with themselves equal to 1).

## Splitting the Equation with Inner Products

- Taking the inner product of the equation with respect to psi1 and psi2 separately.
- Inner product with psi1:
    - Resulting term: iħ(dC1/dt)e^(-iω1t).
    - Inner product of psi1 with psi1 = 1.
    - Equation simplifies to dC1/dt = 0.
- Inner product with psi2:
    - Resulting term: iħ(dC2/dt)e^(-iω2t).
    - Inner product of psi1 with psi2 = 0 (orthogonality).
    - Equation simplifies to dC2/dt = 0.

## Time Independence and Probability Interpretation

- C1 and C2 do not change with time.
- If no electric field or photons are applied, an electron initially in state 1 (e1) will remain in that state indefinitely.
- Probability of being in state 1: |C1|^2.
- Probability of being in state 2: |C2|^2.

## Next Steps: Perturbation Theory and Introducing Light

- Application of perturbation theory to analyze the system under the influence of light.
- Expectation of changing coefficients over time, indicating the need for a function of time to describe their behavior.

## Conclusion

- Encouragement to practice taking inner products and understanding orthogonality.
- Introduction of perturbation theory in the next video to study the effects of light on the system.

    - Hamiltonian (H) is replaced by H0 + H', where H0 represents the original Hamiltonian and H' is the perturbing Hamiltonian (additional potential energy).
    - H' is a function of space and time.
- Wave function: psi(x, t) = C1 * psi1(x) * e^(-i_omega1_t) + C2 * psi2(x) * e^(-i_omega2_t)
    - omega1 = e1 / hbar
    - omega2 = e2 / hbar
- Plugging H' into the Schrödinger equation and simplifying.
- H' corresponds to the incoming electric field, represented as a traveling wave with a wavelength much larger than the distances involved in the Schrödinger equation.

- The wave function is a linear combination of the wave functions Sy1 and Sy2, with coefficients C1 and C2 as functions of time.
- The Schrödinger equation yields differential equations for C1 and C2.
- The equations involve complex exponentials and cosine terms, making them complicated.

## Simplification and Approximation

- Dividing both sides of the equations by iħ simplifies the equations.
- Introducing the term Delta Omega (Δω) to represent the energy difference between the two levels.
- The equations are written in terms of ΔΩT and cosine(ΩLT).
- The initial conditions are C1(0) = 1 and C2(0) = 0.
- An approximation is made to consider C1 as a constant equal to 1, simplifying the first differential equation.
- The second differential equation for C2 remains unchanged.

## Integration and Solution

- Integrating the second differential equation for C2 from 0 to T gives the solution.
- The integral involves complex exponentials and a cosine term.

- The final equation involves a constant coefficient and complex exponentials, with an emphasis on the term related to Delta Omega and Omega L.

## Further Simplification

- Frequencies close to Delta Omega are of interest, where Omega L is approximately equal to Delta Omega.
- In this case, the term related to Delta Omega - Omega L is negligible compared to the other term.

## Introduction

[Fermi's Golden Rule Part 6 - The Golden Rule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNzR-Y-fK84&list=PLQms29D1RqeJQhEGjEqZVXDtuQWtuqr1h&index=12)


- The video is about deriving Fermi's golden rule and interpreting it on a macroscopic level.
- Transitioning from a two-level system to macroscopic quantities.
- The system consists of energy levels e1 and e2, wave functions, and coefficients C1 and C2.

## Derivation of C2

- The coefficient C2 is derived as a function of time.
- It is represented as C2(t) = (Qe0 / ħ) * matrix element * exponential function.

## Interpreting Macroscopic Quantities

- Consider a two-level system corresponding to a semiconductor, like silicon.
- Assume there are 10 electrons in the system, primarily in energy level e1.
- As time passes, electrons can transition to energy level e2.
- Magnitude of C2 squared represents the probability of an electron being in state 2.

## Transition Rate

- The percentage of total electrons transitioning or getting absorbed per unit time is determined by differentiating magnitude C2 squared with respect to time.
- The derivative provides the transition rate or recombination/generation rate.

## Simplification Trick

- Simplifying the sinc squared function by plotting it as a function of frequency difference (Δω - ωL).
- As time increases, the sinc squared function approaches a delta function.
- The sinc squared function can be approximated as 2π/T times a delta function.

## Fermi's Golden Rule

- Fermi's golden rule states that the transition rate of electrons is given by B squared times 2π times the delta function.
- B squared is a coefficient involving physical quantities and the matrix element.
- The transition rate remains constant, reflecting the steady absorption of photons per unit time.

## Absorption Coefficient

- The absorption coefficient is proportional to the magnitude of the electric field squared.
- The number of photons absorbed is directly related to the magnitude of the electric field.
