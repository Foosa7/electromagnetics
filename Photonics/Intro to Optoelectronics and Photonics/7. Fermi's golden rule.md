## Overview

- Topic: Two-level systems and the time-dependent Schrödinger equation.
- Objective: Analyze the system with two energy levels (e1 and e2) under the influence of light.
- Wave functions: psi1(x, t) corresponds to energy level e1, and psi2(x, t) corresponds to energy level e2.

## The Differential Equation

- Derived differential equation: iħ(dC1/dt)e^(-iω1t)psi1(x) + iħ(dC2/dt)e^(-iω2t)psi2(x) = 0.
- Desire for separate equations for C1 and C2.

## Utilizing Inner Products and Orthogonality

- Inner product and orthogonality concepts revisited.
- psi1 and psi2 are orthogonal wave functions.
- Inner product of psi1 and psi2 is zero due to orthogonality.
- Proper normalization of psi1 and psi2 (inner products with themselves equal to 1).

## Splitting the Equation with Inner Products

- Taking the inner product of the equation with respect to psi1 and psi2 separately.
- Inner product with psi1:
    - Resulting term: iħ(dC1/dt)e^(-iω1t).
    - Inner product of psi1 with psi1 = 1.
    - Equation simplifies to dC1/dt = 0.
- Inner product with psi2:
    - Resulting term: iħ(dC2/dt)e^(-iω2t).
    - Inner product of psi1 with psi2 = 0 (orthogonality).
    - Equation simplifies to dC2/dt = 0.

## Time Independence and Probability Interpretation

- C1 and C2 do not change with time.
- If no electric field or photons are applied, an electron initially in state 1 (e1) will remain in that state indefinitely.
- Probability of being in state 1: |C1|^2.
- Probability of being in state 2: |C2|^2.

## Next Steps: Perturbation Theory and Introducing Light

- Application of perturbation theory to analyze the system under the influence of light.
- Expectation of changing coefficients over time, indicating the need for a function of time to describe their behavior.

## Conclusion

- In this video we do not apply any external field or photon and saw that the electron stays in the same band as expected and it is not time dependent
- Encouragement to practice taking inner products and understanding orthogonality.
- Introduction of perturbation theory in the next video to study the effects of light on the system.

## Raw notes
- In this video we talk about 
	- We inject a photon and see how the schrodingers equation modifies
	- Pertubing hamiltonian which is a function of both space and time
	- We modify the equation
