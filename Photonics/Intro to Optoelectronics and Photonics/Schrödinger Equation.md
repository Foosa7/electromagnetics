## About
- Schrödinger equation is a central equation in quantum mechanics that describes the behavior of quantum particles, such as electrons, in terms of wavefunctions. 
- It predicts the probability distribution of finding a particle at a particular location and time.
- The Schrödinger equation is a wave equation that describes the time evolution of the wavefunction, taking into account the particle's mass, potential energy, and the laws of quantum mechanics
- When dealing with particles in quantum mechanics, their wave-like behavior is described by wavefunctions, which satisfy the Schrödinger equation
- The probability distribution of finding a particle is determined by the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction.
- When particles are subject to electromagnetic fields, the Schrödinger equation can be coupled with Maxwell's equations. This leads to the development of quantum electrodynamics (QED)
- In QED, the electromagnetic field is described by quantized excitations called photons which are particles that mediate the electromagnetic force.

## Time independent Schrödinger Equation
- Once we have the energies we can use this equation to solve two level systems



## two level systems:
- We have conduction and valence bands that has several bands so we simplify by picking one on the top and bottom, this is to simplify the calculation
- What happens when there's an incoming photon in this two level system. Maybe an absorption and energy levels of the electron goes up?

## modelling the system
- We use the schrodinger equation to model the system
- we need to find the hamiltonian and the wave function is complicated so we just say psi1(x, t) and psi2(x, t)
- so psi1(x, 0) = psi2(x, 0) and eventually psi1(x, infinite) = psi2(x, infinite)
- eventually it'll be some coefficients ---- that we substitute back
