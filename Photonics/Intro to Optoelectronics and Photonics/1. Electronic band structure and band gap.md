### Individual atoms: Interaction
- When two electrons interact, wave functions have a constructive and distructive interference.
- Stable lower orbitols do not interact generally, these just add up 1+1.
- Higher level orbitals generally split to two different energy levels.

### Multiple to many atoms
- When 8x of 3s orbitols interact we'll have 8 different individual energy levels.
- This model is called LCAO - linear combination of atomic orbitals.
- _Valance level orbitals have splitting_
- Number of orbitals = no of orbitals out

### Macroscopic object
- If the seperation of the energy level is so small it's then called a band. Large number of very closely spaced atoms
- Silicon has both 3s and 3p levels: when combined gives us just two continious band with a small sepration
	- Conduction band
	- Eg (Band gap)
	- Valence band 

Summary
1. Valence orbitals interact
2. Number of orbitals in = no of orbitals out
3. These create condation and valence band
4. Band is a large number of very closely spaced energy levels
5. Band structure describes the density and spacing of these energy levels
