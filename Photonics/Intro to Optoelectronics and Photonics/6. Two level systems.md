## About


## Introduction to Two-Level Systems

- Two-level system consists of two states with different energies, denoted as e1 and e2.
- Simplified representation used in semiconductor physics to analyze systems.
- Conduction and valence bands in semiconductors contain closely spaced energy states.
- Focus on one state in each band (e1 and e2) for simplicity.
- It's simpler to analyze two level systems than bands.

## Interaction of Light with Two-Level Systems

- Interested in how light interacts with matter, specifically a semiconductor.
- When irradiated with light, semiconductors absorb photons based on their frequency.
- Expectation that electrons transition from low energy state (e1) to high energy state (e2).
- We use Schrodinger equation to derive the exact behavior in this situation.

## Modeling the System

- Using quantum mechanics, particularly Schrodinger's equation, to model the system.
- Schrodinger's equation: IH̄ dΨ/dt = HΨ, where Ψ represents the wave function.
- Two-level system exists in a crystal lattice, wave functions are complex for two states.
- Approximation: Ψ1 and Ψ2 as simple functions without considering the lattice complexity.
- Simplifying the equation to ease the analysis.

## Wave Function and Coefficients

- Wave function Ψtotal is a combination of two unknown coefficients C1 and C2.
- C1 and C2 vary with time and represent the probabilities of being in states e1 and e2.
- Initial conditions: C1 at time 0 is 1, C2 at time 0 is 0 (electron in state e1).
- Expectation: C1 approaches 0 and C2 approaches 1 as time approaches infinity (electron in state e2).
- Interested in determining C1 and C2 as functions of time.

## Plugging into the Schrodinger Equation

- Substituting the wave function and coefficients into the Schrodinger equation.
- Applying the time dependence explicitly for C1 and C2.
- Left-hand side: IH̄ dC1/dt * e^(-iΩ1t) * Ψ1 + IH̄ dC2/dt * e^(-iΩ2t) * Ψ2.
- Right-hand side: C1 * e^(-iΩ1t) * H * Ψ1 + C2 * e^(-iΩ2t) * H * Ψ2.

## Simplifications and Cancelling Terms

- Utilizing the time-independent Schrodinger equation to simplify the Hamiltonian terms.
- Hamiltonian acting on Ψ1 replaced by e1 * C1.
- Hamiltonian acting on Ψ2 replaced by e2 * C2.
- Cancelling terms between the left and right-hand sides.
- Final differential equation: IH̄ dC1/dt * e^(-iΩ1t) + IH̄ dC2/dt * e^(-iΩ2t) = 0.

## Conclusion and Next Steps

- The derived differential equation serves as the starting point for Fermi's golden rule.
- Fermi's golden rule will be explored in the next video.
