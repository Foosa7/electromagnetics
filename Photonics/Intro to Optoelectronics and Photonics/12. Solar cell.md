## Solar Cell Basics

- A solar cell is a semiconductor device, typically made of silicon, that converts solar radiation into electrical energy.
- Solar cells generate electron-hole pairs when exposed to sunlight, where electrons and holes are the charge carriers.
- The challenge is to extract these generated carriers to make them useful for power generation.

## Built-in Electric Field

- Applying an external voltage to a solar cell can generate a current, but it requires supplying energy to extract the carriers, resulting in no power output.
- It is desirable to have a built-in electric field inside the solar cell, which automatically sweeps out the carriers for power generation.
- The built-in electric field can be achieved by creating a PN junction within the solar cell.
- The PN junction consists of a P-side (with positively charged ions) and an N-side (with negatively charged ions), creating a depletion region.

## Solar Cell Circuit Model

- The standard solar cell architecture consists of a PN junction with an intrinsic region for carrier absorption.
- To understand the solar cell as a circuit, a simplified circuit model is used.
- The solar cell circuit model includes a diode and a photocurrent source in parallel.
- The diode represents the PN junction, and the photocurrent source represents the generated electron-hole pairs.

## Open Circuit Voltage

- The accumulated carriers in the solar cell structure create an electric field that opposes the built-in electric field.
- This opposition leads to an open circuit voltage, which is a measurable voltage across the solar cell when it is not connected to any external load.
- The open circuit voltage can be calculated using the diode current equation and rearranged to find the voltage.

## Basic Model of a Solar Cell

- A solar cell consists of a current source (photo current) and a diode (P-I-N structure).
- The photo current depends on the incident solar radiation.

## Load Resistance and Energy Extraction

- Attaching a load resistance to the solar cell allows energy extraction.
- The load resistance is modeled as a resistor.
- The current flowing through the load resistor (IL) is of interest for energy extraction.

## Short Circuit Configuration

- When RL = 0 (short circuit), the voltage across the load is 0.
- All the photo current flows through the load resistor (IL = short-circuit current).
- The power extracted from this configuration is 0.

## Various Load Resistance Values

- When RL is slightly above 0, the load voltage is small, and the diode is slightly forward-biased.
- As RL increases, the voltage across the diode (VL) increases, and the diode current becomes appreciable.
- When RL approaches infinity, almost all the current flows through the diode, and VL is equal to the open circuit voltage.

## I-V Characteristics of a Solar Cell

- The I-V characteristics of a solar cell resemble an upside-down diode curve.
- Initially, the load current (IL) is approximately equal to the short-circuit current.
- As RL increases, the load current decreases.
- As RL approaches infinity, the load current becomes zero at the open circuit voltage.

## Power Maximization (I-V Charateristics)

- To maximize power to the load, both current and voltage need to be maximized or their product.
- The operating point that maximizes power is typically at the knee of the curve where the current starts to decrease while the voltage continues to increase.

## Numerical Analysis and Curve Plotting

- The equations for the solar cell circuit are transcendental and require numerical solutions.
- By solving the equations numerically, the relationship between VL, IL, and RL can be determined.
- Plotting the values of RL can generate the I-V curve of the solar cell.

## Summary of Circuit Model

- The circuit model includes the short circuit current, diode current, and load resistor.
- As RL approaches infinity, almost all the current flows through the diode.
- When RL is close to zero, almost all the current flows through the load resistor.
- The operating point for maximum power is where the current starts to decrease and the voltage continues to increase.
