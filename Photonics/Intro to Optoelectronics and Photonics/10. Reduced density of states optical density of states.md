## Introduction

- The reduced density of states, also known as the optical density of states, is discussed in this video.
- The reduced density of states allows us to treat the band structure as a collection of two-level systems with energy levels E2 and E1.
- Conservation of momentum determines the distance between the conduction band and the valence band that enables transitions caused by incoming photons.

## Transition Rate and Density of States

- Fermi's Golden Rule is used to calculate the transition rate (W) from state 1 to state 2, which represents the percentage of electrons that absorb a photon per unit time.
- The transition rate is determined by the electric field amplitude (E0), matrix elements (i1 ex-situ), and the difference between the frequency of light and the frequency difference between the two energy levels.
- The density of states (g) represents the number of available states for electrons to transition to.
- The reduced density of states represents the available states as a function of the photon energy.

## Deriving the Reduced Density of States

- The band structure is depicted, showing the photon energy (Ephoton) and the change in photon energy (dEphoton).
- The photon energy is related to momentum, and expressions for the energy above the conduction band (Delta EC) and the energy below the valence band (Delta EV) are derived.
- The total photon energy is obtained by adding the band gap energy (EG) and the energy above the conduction band and below the valence band.
- By solving for momentum (K), the reduced density of states as a function of photon energy is derived.

## Calculation of Absorption Efficiency

- The reduced density of states (g) is multiplied by the differential element (dEphoton) to obtain the number of states available in energy level E1 per unit volume.
- The next step involves integrating the density of states and dealing with the delta function and frequency-to-energy conversion.
- The calculation of the absorption efficiency, which completes the process, will be covered in the next video.

## Conclusion

- The video concludes with a call to action for liking, subscribing, and leaving comments.
- The absorption efficiency calculation, based on the derived reduced density of states, will be the focus of the next video.
