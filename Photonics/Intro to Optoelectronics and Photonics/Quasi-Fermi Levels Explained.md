## What's a fermi level?
The **Fermi level** of a solid state body is the [thermodynamic work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_work) required to add one electron to the body. The Fermi level does not include the work required to remove the electron from wherever it came from. 
quantity usually denoted by _µ_ or _E_F

### [The Fermi Energy What does it Mean? Lecture 14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sH5HkF-9X2c&list=PLmfHzApbF5dYnZTqPDsJj31mOQtD7vDT2&index=15)
- the **valence band** and **conduction band** are the [bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_band_structure "Electronic band structure") closest to the [Fermi level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_level "Fermi level"), and thus determine the [electrical conductivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductivity "Electrical conductivity") of the solid.
- **Band Gap:** Energy range in a solid where no electron states can exist due to the quantization of energy.
- **Conduction band:**  Lowest range of vacant electronic states
- For every electron in the conduction there's a hole in the valence band or an ionised doner n = p.
- A voltmeter _measures differences in Fermi level divided by electron charge_

#### Consiquences of n = p
- Fermi energy is ~ (Ev + Ec)/2
- We care about the difference between fermi energy and valence energy generally
Come back to this topic tomorrow


- For N-type semiconductor the fermilevel will be in the top half In the band diagram 
- Very powerful helped us understand PN, BJT, MOS
- Breaks down under non equilibrium (injected electron or injected holes)

## Why does it breakdown
- Take a semiconductor and shine light forever, this generates holes and electrons
- In steady state we have a generation rate in which the number of holes and electrons keep adding with the generation rate this is determined by the _continuity equation_.
- The problem arrises due to two different fermi levels one for electrons and another for the holes.
- When this happens the fermi energy is not defined anymore we then define quasi fermi energy as they are both different: quasi fermi energy for holes, quasi fermi energy for electrons.
- The electron fermi level moves up and the holes one moves down.
- These quasi fermi levels are _SUPER_ useful in opto electrons so it's important to understand what this is all about.
