### Why do we care?
- QM is Description of the electronic structure of atom and matter
	- Electronic density
	- Bonding 
	- Optical, electrical, and thermal properties
- Band gap and the curvature of the bands as they get close to eachother affect how electrons move: electronic transport

### What is this QM all about
- If we describe electron as a wave, when we operate it on a wave function (hamiltonian) we get back the same wave function back times a scalar
- We foucs on time independent schrodinger equation
- **Schrodinger equation:** 
	- Describes a wave function. 
	- In order to describe a specific electron wave function we substitute the K.E. and P.E.
	- The solution gives us conditions for the wave function that when satisified represents the original wave function. 
- Hamiltonian operator has two components
	- Kinetic energy: 
	- Potential energy: for an atom it's the nucleus and the electron (coulombic potential)
- _what does he mean by operate?_
- Classical particle in a box problem
- _Write latex here_
- This above equation describes some wave function. In order to describe the electron in hydrogen atom it must satisify the above wave function.
- The solution has legere function + sperical harmonics: the solution is giving us conditions for the wave function to satisify the in order to be a solution to the original problem

### Schrodinger Equation
- **Schrodinger equation:** 
	- Describes a wave function. 
	- In order to describe a specific electron wave function we substitute the K.E. and P.E.
	- The solution gives us conditions for the wave function that when satisified represents the original wave function. 
- **Schrodinger equation for Hydrogen:** 
	- Put the coulombic potential in V(r)
	- We get a set of solutions that describe the potential wave functions that electrons can occupy for hydrogen
	- Rules we get from the solution have these numbers:
		- Principle quantum number (n): tells us the shell
		- Azimuthal/Angular momentum quantum number (l): tells us the shape of the orbital probablity density in 3D 
		- Magnetic quantum number (ml): orientation of the orbital (the plane along some axis)
		- Spin quantum number (ms): 
	- Quantum numbers give potential solution to the wave number
	- Physically the wave function can be interpreted as the square of wave function is proportial to the probablity density: this value gives us the shape of the electronic orbital

### Linking it to the periodic table
- Basically how 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d are represented in the periodic table

## Summary
- QM is nessary to describe stuff and understand electronic properties and distribution bonding etc. 
- Quantum numbers are integers that give potential solutions to the wave function
- We can't solve the schrodinger equations for more than 2 electrons, we use approximations
- Density functional theory and quantum mechanical modelling deal with computational modeling to solve
