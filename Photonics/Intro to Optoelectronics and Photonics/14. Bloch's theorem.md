## Introduction:

- Bloch's theorem is a fundamental concept used in quantum mechanics and other disciplines that rely on periodicity and symmetry.
- It allows us to exploit symmetry to simplify calculations and understand the behavior of wave functions in crystals.
- In quantum mechanics, we are interested in the symmetry properties of crystals and how they affect wave functions.

## Symmetry of Crystals:

- Crystals have a periodic arrangement of atoms.
- By assuming an infinite crystal lattice or a circular lattice, we can exploit periodic boundary conditions.
- The wave function (probability or magnitude of the wave function) should be the same at different positions within the crystal.
- Mathematically, this is expressed as the magnitude squared of ψ(X) = magnitude squared of ψ(X + a), where a is the distance between atoms.
- This implies that ψ(X + a) can differ from ψ(X) only by a coefficient C with magnitude 1.

## Periodic Boundary Conditions:

- To analyze the symmetry properties, we consider a circular lattice or an infinitely large crystal.
- When we move along the lattice, the wave function changes by a coefficient C each time we pass an atom.
- After n atoms, when we return to the starting atom, the wave functions must be equal: C^n ψ(X) = ψ(X).
- This leads to the conclusion that C^n = 1, and C must be an nth root of unity, which can be expressed as e^(i 2πs/n), where s is an integer from 0 to n-1.

## Wave Function and Crystal Momentum:

- We aim to find the wave function ψ(X) that satisfies the periodicity condition.
- By making the substitution K = 2πs/n, we obtain a simpler form: ψ(X) = e^(i KX), where K is called crystal momentum.
- The wave function can be written as e^(i KX) multiplied by a periodic function u_K(X).
- The periodic function u_K(X) satisfies u_K(X + a) = u_K(X) and represents additional periodicity hidden within the wave function.

## Conclusion:

- Bloch's theorem states that wave functions in a crystal can be written as e^(i KX) multiplied by a periodic function.
- The crystal momentum K is an analog of momentum in the crystal lattice.
- This theorem helps simplify calculations and understand the behavior of wave functions in crystals.

## Key Points

### 1. Symmetry in Infinite Chains and Free Space

- In an infinite chain of atoms or free space, all points are indistinguishable, and the wave function's probability is expected to be the same at any position.

### 2. Periodic Boundary Conditions

- By imposing periodic boundary conditions, a ring-like structure is created to mimic an infinite system locally.

### 3. Steps around the Ring and Constant Multiplication

- Taking steps around the ring and multiplying the wave function at each step by a constant, a relationship is derived: Psi(X + n*epsilon) = C^n * Psi(X), where C is an nth root of unity.

### 4. Continuous Variable K and Limit as Epsilon Approaches 0

- By taking the limit as epsilon approaches 0, a continuous variable K is introduced: e^(iKX).

### 5. Wave Function Representation as a Sum over K Values

- The wave function Psi(X) can be represented as a sum over all K values: Psi(X) = sum(C(K) * e^(iKX)), similar to a Fourier series.
