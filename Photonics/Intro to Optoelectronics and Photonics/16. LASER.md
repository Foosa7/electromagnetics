When the photon energy is less than ΔEF, it means that the energy of the incident photons is lower than the energy required to excite electrons across the Fermi level splitting. In this case, the electrons in the valence band cannot directly absorb the photons and transition to the conduction band.

However, there are other processes at play in a semiconductor that can lead to gain. One such process is stimulated emission, which is the basis of laser operation. In stimulated emission, an excited electron in the conduction band can relax to a lower energy state by emitting a photon. This emitted photon has the same energy and phase as the incident photon that stimulated the emission.

In a semiconductor with a carrier density (electron concentration) higher than the transparency carrier density (ntr), the presence of excess electrons in the conduction band increases the probability of stimulated emission. These excess electrons can recombine with holes (electron vacancies) in the valence band, releasing photons in the process.

This recombination process results in the emission of additional photons, amplifying the original incident optical signal and leading to gain. The gain occurs at photon energies lower than ΔEF because the excess carriers in the conduction band facilitate the stimulated emission process, even if the direct absorption of photons across the band gap is not possible.

It's important to note that this gain mechanism is specific to semiconductor materials and is a fundamental principle underlying the operation of semiconductor lasers and optical amplifiers. The ability to achieve gain at photon energies lower than ΔEF is what enables efficient light amplification and emission in semiconductor devices.
