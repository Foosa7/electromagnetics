### Absorption Spectra of a Semiconductor

- The absorption spectra of a semiconductor shows zero absorption below the bandgap energy.
- Above the bandgap, the absorption follows a square root dependence on the photon energy minus the bandgap energy.
- At low temperatures, the absorption curve is influenced by the carrier density and the transparency carrier density.
- Beyond the transparency carrier density, the absorption curve can exhibit negative absorption or gain.
- The gain curve is the negative of the absorption curve.

### Gain as a Function of Carrier Density

- Increasing the carrier density beyond the transparency carrier density leads to gain instead of absorption.
- The gain curve can be plotted as a function of photon energy, with gain becoming negative above a certain carrier density (Fermi level splitting).
- The peak gain represents the maximum gain for a given carrier density.
- The peak gain is of particular interest for efficient laser operation.

### Relationship Between Carrier Density and Peak Gain

- The peak gain can be plotted as a function of carrier density.
- Increasing the carrier density leads to an increase in the Fermi level splitting and a shift in the absorption/gain crossover point.
- The peak gain curve shows a gentle sloping line with increasing carrier density.
- The peak gain can be approximated using a logarithmic expression: G_0 * log(n / n_TR), where n is the carrier density and n_TR is the transparency carrier density.
- G_0 is a fitting parameter that depends on the semiconductor.

### Laser Cavities

- Laser cavities are structures consisting of a gain medium (such as a semiconductor) placed between two mirrors.
- The gain medium amplifies an incident electric field, leading to an increase in the electric field strength within the cavity.
- The output electric field and intensity are determined by the gain of the medium and the length of the cavity.

### Reflection and Transmission in Cavities

- When an electric field is incident on a mirror, a portion of it is reflected (R) and a portion is transmitted (T).
- The reflection and transmission coefficients (R and T) depend on the refractive indices and wave impedances of the materials involved.
- In a laser cavity, the incident field undergoes multiple reflections and transmissions between the mirrors.

### Field Propagation and Gain

- Inside the gain medium, the electric field experiences amplification or gain (G).
- The total electric field at the output of the cavity is determined by the cumulative effect of multiple reflections and transmissions.
- The field amplitude grows exponentially with each round trip, resulting in a large output field.

### Infinite Series Representation

- The total electric field can be expressed as an infinite series, taking into account the multiple reflections and transmissions.
- The series involves the reflection coefficient squared (R^2) and the exponential factor e^(2GTL), where L is the length of the gain medium.
- The series can be simplified using the formula for a geometric series.

### Self-Sustaining Oscillations

- The goal of a laser cavity is to achieve self-sustaining oscillations, even in the absence of an incident electric field.
- A small starting electric field, such as from spontaneous emission, can build up within the cavity and lead to a large self-sustaining output field.
- The cavity acts as an amplifier, generating a significant output intensity compared to the incident intensity.

### Finite Limitations

- The output intensity is not truly infinite due to limitations imposed by the available carriers in the gain medium.
- At a certain point, all electrons will have transitioned to the valence band, reducing the carrier density and limiting the gain.
- The dynamics of carriers and photons in the cavity are essential to understanding these limitations.

### Implications and Applications

- The gain expression as a function of carrier density is useful for analyzing the dynamics of lasers.
- It helps relate carrier density to the number of photons in the cavity and determines the laser's frequency response.
- The expression also provides constraints on the mirror choice for laser cavities, considering mirror losses and the required carrier density for compensation.

When the photon energy is less than ΔEF, it means that the energy of the incident photons is lower than the energy required to excite electrons across the Fermi level splitting. In this case, the electrons in the valence band cannot directly absorb the photons and transition to the conduction band.

However, there are other processes at play in a semiconductor that can lead to gain. One such process is stimulated emission, which is the basis of laser operation. In stimulated emission, an excited electron in the conduction band can relax to a lower energy state by emitting a photon. This emitted photon has the same energy and phase as the incident photon that stimulated the emission.

In a semiconductor with a carrier density (electron concentration) higher than the transparency carrier density (ntr), the presence of excess electrons in the conduction band increases the probability of stimulated emission. These excess electrons can recombine with holes (electron vacancies) in the valence band, releasing photons in the process.

This recombination process results in the emission of additional photons, amplifying the original incident optical signal and leading to gain. The gain occurs at photon energies lower than ΔEF because the excess carriers in the conduction band facilitate the stimulated emission process, even if the direct absorption of photons across the band gap is not possible.

It's important to note that this gain mechanism is specific to semiconductor materials and is a fundamental principle underlying the operation of semiconductor lasers and optical amplifiers. The ability to achieve gain at photon energies lower than ΔEF is what enables efficient light amplification and emission in semiconductor devices.
