Incorporating Lean Agile principles into your study process using a Kanban board can help you manage your tasks more efficiently and adapt to changing priorities. Here are some steps to incorporate Lean Agile principles and suggestions for Kanban board titles:

1.  Visualize your workflow: Divide your study tasks into stages and represent on Kanban board:
    -   Backlog: To study but haven't started yet
    -   To Study:
    -   In Progress:
    -   Review:
    -   Completed: 
2.  Limit work in progress (WIP): Set limits on the number of tasks allowed in each stage to avoid multitasking and focus on the most important tasks first. This will help you maintain a steady pace and minimize context switching.
3.  Break down tasks: Break down larger tasks or topics into smaller, manageable sub-tasks. This will help you track your progress and make it easier to adjust your priorities if needed.
4.  Prioritize tasks: Use a priority system to rank tasks based on their importance and urgency. You can use labels, colors, or a simple numbering system to indicate priority levels.
5.  Continuously update your board: As you complete tasks or encounter new information, update your Kanban board to reflect the current state of your studies. This will help you maintain a clear understanding of your progress and adapt to changes quickly.
6.  Reflect and improve: Periodically review your workflow and identify any bottlenecks or inefficiencies. Adjust your process or priorities as needed to improve your overall study efficiency.
7.  Incorporate feedback loops: Use your experiences and the feedback you receive from instructors, classmates, or study partners to inform your study priorities and make adjustments to your workflow.    

Using these Lean Agile principles along with a Kanban board can help you manage your study tasks more effectively, enabling you to adapt to changes, focus on high-priority tasks, and continuously improve your study process.
