Lithography is used to selectively remove oxide from areas in which dopant atoms are to be introduced

Major steps in the lithography process: 
1. Application of resist: 
	- Liquid photoresist is placed on the wafer, and the wafer is spun at high speed to produce a thin, uniform coating. 
	- After spinning, a short bake at about 90 °C is performed to drive solvent out of the resist.
2. Resist exposure through a mask and an optical reduction system:
	- photomask is a quartz photoplate containing the patterns. Exposed regions undergo chemical reactions. 
	- Two types of resists:
		- __Negative resists:__ 
			- wherever light strikes gets polymerised; difficult to dissolve in solvents.
			- When exposed to developer (solvent) the polymerised regions remain and unexposed regions wash away.
		- __Positive resists__:  
			- whenever light strikes this breaks down; contain a stablizer that slows down the dissolution rate 
3. After development of exposed photoresist: 
	- Buffered hydrofluric acid (HF) is generally used to desolve the unprotected regions of the oxide film
4. After oxide etching and resist removal: photoresist is removed in a step called resist strip by burning the resist in oxygen plasma or UV ozone system called asher

## Lithography resolution
- Due to optical diffraction the minimum feature size is: 
	- Lithography Resolution = kλ
- As the wavelength is reduced the resolution increases but difficult to find transparent lenses and mask plates at this wavelength 
- **Lithography field**: small area of the silicon exposed to the UV may contain many ICs 
- **Stepper**: lithography equipment is generally called stepper for it's step and repeat action.
- **Optical proximity correction**: Close features can bridge sometimes, this can be avoided by altering the photomask by making it slightly thinner. The computation performed is called OPC very computational intensive.

## Enhancement techniques
- Several enhancement techniques are used to improve the resolution some of them include:
	- Phase shift photomask
	- Horizontal and verticle line patterns with two masks
