## Planar technology
Step-by-step and layer-upon-layer method of making circuits on a wafer substrate is called planar technology.

Some basic steps in the silicon device fabrication process: 
(a) oxidation of silicon by forming SiO2 layer
(b) selective oxide removal
(c) introduction of dopant atoms
(d) diffusion of dopant atoms into silicon
