## Oxidation of Silicon

Silicon oxide is the most critical component in the metal oxide semiconductor transistor. It is also used as a mask against dopant introduction into silicon. 

## Producing the SiO2
- Precise layers are produced by using the following two reactions:
	- Si + O2 → SiO2 (using oxygen gas) 
	- Si + 2H2 O → SiO2 + 2H2 (using water vapour at an elevated temperature)
- Oxidizing species diffuses through existing oxide to form more SiO2.

## Types of Oxidation
- **Dry Oxidation:** using oxygen gas, _used to form thin oxide films_.
- **Wet Oxidation**: using water vapour, _faster rate, preferred in forming thicker oxides_ as water vapour diffuses faster than Oxygen through SiO2.

## Furnace
- **Horizontal:** Horizontal furnaces typically have convection currents inside the tube which causes the bottom of the tube to be slightly colder than the top of the tube. [As the wafers lie vertically in the tube the convection and the temperature gradient with it causes the top of the wafer to have a thicker oxide than the bottom of the wafer](https://cense.engr.uky.edu/equipment/furnaces)[1](https://cense.engr.uky.edu/equipment/furnaces).
- **Vertical:** Vertical furnaces stand higher than horizontal furnaces, so they may not fit into some microfabrication facilities. However, they help to prevent dust contamination. [Unlike horizontal furnaces, in which falling dust can contaminate any wafer, vertical furnaces only allow it to fall on the top wafer in the boat](https://cense.engr.uky.edu/equipment/furnaces)[1](https://cense.engr.uky.edu/equipment/furnaces)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_oxidation)
- **Temperatures:** 700-1200 °C is produced by electrical resistance heating coils.
