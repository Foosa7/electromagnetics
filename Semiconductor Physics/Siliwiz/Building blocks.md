## N-MOSFET
- Base: p substrate 
- Body: n diffusion
- Gate: poly silicon
- Fanout: metal1 
- Pins: 
	- Gate: connected to polysilicon. Thinner gate more current in the saturation region.
	- Drain: metal1 via has to be in the body
	- Source: metal1 via has to be in the body
- The N MOSFET conducts about 2.6 times better than P MOSFET.
- Drawing a P MOSFET 2.6 times wider than the N MOSFET will give it the same performance as the N MOSFET.
- [Explanation](https://tinytapeout.com/siliwiz/inverter/ "Making a logic inverter"): This is due to the N type doping having excess electrons, which carry the current, compared to the P type doping which has gaps between electrons, and the movement of these electron “holes” is what carries the current. This is analogous to water quickly falling though air, vs a bubble of air rising much slower though water. (Alternate explanation: cars driving on a road vs a traffic jam where the gap between cars is moving backwards as the cars move slowly forwards).
